# Practical Task 9
"Unit test frameworks" module:

Modify the application from the first task of the Basic of .NET framework and C # by separating the functionality of counting the maximum number of unequal consecutive characters in a string into a separate method. Extend functionality by adding two more methods:
- determining the maximum number of consecutive identical letters of the Latin alphabet in a line
- determining the maximum number of consecutive identical digits

For each method, write Unit Tests (use the NUnit, XUnit or MSTest framework is your choice; follow AAA and FIRST). When creating tests, pay special attention to equivalence classes.
