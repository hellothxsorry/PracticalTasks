# Practical Task 5
"Interfaces and Abstract Classes" module: 

Create a "Coordinate" structure that defines the 3D coordinates of some object (positive numbers). Define an IFlyable interface with the FlyTo (new point), GetFlyTime (new point) methods. Create classes "Bird", "Airplane", "Drone", which implement this interface and contain at least the field "Current position".

Use the following assumptions: the bird flies the entire distance at a constant speed in the range of 0-20 km/h (set randomly), the aircraft increases speed by 10 km/h every 10 km of flight from an initial speed of 200 km/h, the drone hovers in the air every 10 minutes of flight for 1 minute. Based on the task, introduce additional restrictions (for example, the impossibility of flying a drone at a distance of more than 1000 km). Describe the methods and restrictions imposed in the comments.
